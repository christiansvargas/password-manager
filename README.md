# Password Manager

Hi, my name is **Christian**, and this project is my high school IB Computer Science Internal Assessment: a simple desktop password manager. It lets you create a master login and then store, view, and update website credentials locally on your computer. I built it because I wanted an offline tool I fully understood end-to-end while practicing Java fundamentals and basic software design (MVC). This is a learning project, and it is not meant for production security, so please don't store real passwords.

## Frameworks and Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Java 8
- **Libraries:** Core Java SE (Collections, I/O); simple desktop UI in Java (View/Login classes)
- **Architecture:** Lightweight MVC (Model: UserPassword, View: View, Controller/Manager: Manager)
- **Storage:** Local file-based persistence
- **Interface:** Desktop GUI

## Usage
- **Compile:** 'javac *.java'
- **Run:** 'java Login'
- **Tip:** If you prefer a single file, you can package a runnable JAR (entry point Login) and run with 'java -jar password-manager.jar'

## Roadmap
- Store passwords in '.json' format
- Web app UI
- Productivity system (password manager, calendar, to-do list, journal)

## Fun Fact
- This project earned a 6/7 IB score, and it helped me skip two computer science courses in university (Intro to Programming in Python and Object Oriented Programming in Java).
